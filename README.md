# MoneePi – Personal Budgeting App

MoneePi is a simple, privacy-focused budgeting app built with **Flutter** and available on the **Google Play Store**.  
Its goal is to make personal finance tracking fast, intuitive, and distraction-free — without ads, subscriptions, or data collection.

## Why MoneePi?

Many finance apps are cluttered with ads, push premium plans, or require constant internet access. MoneePi takes a different approach:

- **No ads**  
- **No subscriptions**  
- **No internet required**  
- **No data collection**

All your data stays **locally on your device**. It is never uploaded, shared, or sent to any server.  
MoneePi is designed to work completely offline, ensuring maximum privacy.
